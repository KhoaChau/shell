# shell

Basically using this git repo as a backup for my shell related settings and scripts

## ToDo:

create a script that will ask user to punch in all the sensitive info and move files to their forever home.

* ie: edit ssh_config_template and move it to ~/.ssh/config
* where do you want to move the alias and functions file?
* echo "source /path/new_loc_alias" >>Â ~/.shellinterpretor.rc
* echo "source /path/new_loc_funct" >> ~/.shellinterpretor.rc

## Future:

* create a encrypted file that will fill in all the variables. This will be the one stop emergency stop to get up and running with the bare minimum.
