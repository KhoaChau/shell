 shell related settings and scripts

Basically using this git repo as a backup for my settings

ToDo: 
  create a script that will ask user to punch in all the sensitive info and move files to their forever home.
  ie: edit ssh_config_template and move it to ~/.ssh/config
  where do you want to move the alias and functions file?
  echo "source $new_location_alias" >> ~/.shellinterpretor.rc
  echo "source $new_location_function >> ~/.shellinterpretor.rc

Future:
  create a encrypted file that will fill in all the variables. This will be the one stop emergency stop to get up and running with the bare minimum.
